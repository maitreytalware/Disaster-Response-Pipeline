# Disaster Response Pipeline
 
# Introduction
In this project, we will apply our skills to analyze disaster data from **Figure Eight** to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.

We have a data set containing real messages that were sent during disaster events. You will be creating a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that you can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.

Our project will include a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data.
